				Chat: {
					NewMoonDialogue: Ahoy there, when the new moon rises, keep a weathered eye on the Coral Reefs – them jellyfish'll be driftin' 'bout like ghostly lanterns.
					AnglerDialogue0: Aye, me heart aches for me son, off fishin' he went, but the sea's a fickle mistress, and he's yet to make his return.
					AnglerDialogue1: Me lad, he knows the ocean's whispers, so I'm prayin' he's still ridin' those waves.
					AnglerDialogue2: Beggin' yer pardon, have ye spied me son? Beige cap, sturdy vest – that be his mark.
					DayDialogue0: As the dawn breaks and the sky's painted with hues of gold, I find me solace on the pier, breathin' in the salt-kissed mornin' air.
					DayDialogue1: The ocean, she's singin' her siren song today, beckonin' us with her endless tales of adventure.
					DayDialogue2: Did ye see 'em? The sharks, they're dancin' in the waves, a dance of anticipation, or mayhaps they've a tale to share.
					NightDialogue0: When the night's curtain falls upon the sea, tranquility blankets the waves, and the stars reflect like diamonds in liquid darkness.
					NightDialogue1: Ah, the moon – she's a lantern in the sky, castin' her glow upon the water's surface, creatin' a path to the horizon.
					NightDialogue2: Them jellies, their gentle glow pierces the night, enchantin' all who cast their gaze upon the mystical dance.
					RainDialogue0: Rain's fallin', and I can't help but hope it's not heraldin' a tempest's fury – the sea's got a wild heart, ye know.
					RainDialogue1: Lost me rain slicker in a gusty squall a few years back, wishin' for another to shield me from the spray.
					ShipPromptDialogue1: Ahoy there, ye see that old ship wrecked off yonder? Once she was mine, sailed the seven seas, but those days be behind me now.
					ShipPromptDialogue2:
						'''
						If you brought me the following materials along with the payment of:
						- [i/s150:9]
						- [i/s20:225] 
						- [i/s5:73]
						I'd get 'er fixed right up for ya.
						'''
					ShipCommonDialogue0: And don't ye forget, before weighin' anchor, get ya wheel to guide yer ship true through the tempest's embrace.
					ShipCommonDialogue1: Aye, when ye be back from the horizon's edge, swing by and see if I've got fresh sails, wheels, or even cannons to make yer ship a legend on these salty waters.
					ShipRepairDialogue: Thanks be for trustin' me hands – the ship's been put to rights, ready to take on the briny deep once more.
